This document describes the standard Open Supernova Catalog (OSC) JSON format. For JSON files in this repository, which are mostly entered by hand (often via the edit icon on the main table page) or via direct data donations, our format requirements are less strict than usual, for instance if you forget to set a supernova's name field, our import script is smart enough to do this for you. As JSON is a sparse format, object names that don't follow our default name choices will simply be ignored by the script. In most cases, this is not desirable as you will want your data to be readable by the catalog import script, but it can be useful for adding new objects that may be unique to your dataset, which in the future could be parsed by the catalog. But so long as you are only adding standard data to a supernova, it is best to follow the guidelines set in this document as closely as possible to avoid potential issues.

Each supernova is contained with a single JSON file that contains a single object bearing the supernova's primary name, which when empty represents the minimum readable entry file:

```JSON
{
	"SN1987A":{}
}
```

To comply with the standard, the object should contain a `schema` key, where `schema` is a permanent URL to the version of this document defining the file's schema (with `commithash` replaced appropriately), and a `name` key, where the `name` key should be identical to the object field name:

```JSON
{
	"SN1987A":{
		"schema":"https://github.com/astrocatalogs/supernovae/blob/commithash/SCHEMA.md",
		"name":"SN1987A"
	}
}
```

As JSON is a serialized format, *field order does not matter*, but the OSC's import scripts will automatically organize the data in the output JSON files to make them more readable (for instance we sort photometry and spectra within each file by date, the data quantity fields by name, etc.), and to make the outputs more friendly to version control.

Sources are extremely important in the OSC, and every single piece of data added to an event JSON file **must have a source attribution**. Published data sources are preferred over secondary sources (the OSC falls into a secondary source category), but if the data was collected by a secondary source intermediate to being added to the OSC, these sources should also be attributed in the source list.

Sources of data contain several fields:

| Field | Value | Optional?
| :--- | :--- | :---
`name` | Source name, e.g. "Catchpole et al. 1989" | no
`alias` | Integer unique to this source to be used as an alias | no
`url` | Web address of source | yes
`bibcode` | 19 character NASA ADS bibcode | yes
`arxivid` | ArXiv ID number | yes
`secondary` | Boolean specifying if source collected rather than generated data | yes
`acknowledgment` | Acknowledgment requested by source if data is used in publication | yes

The sources object contains an array of such objects:

```JSON
"sources":[
	{
		"name":"Catchpole et al. (1987)",
		"bibcode":"1987MNRAS.229P..15C",
		"alias":"1"
	},
	{
		"name":"SUSPECT",
		"url":"https://www.nhn.ou.edu/~suspect/",
		"alias":"2",
		"secondary":true
	}
]
```

The OSC stores many different pieces of metadata for each event. Data quantities are added to each event as arrays of objects, with each piece of datum being tagged with its associated sources' alias tags. As an example a redshift object array may look like:

```JSON
"redshift":[
	{
		"value":"0.045",
		"e_value":"0.001",
		"source":"1,2",
		"kind":"heliocentric"
	},
	{
		"value":"0.043",
		"e_value":"0.002",
		"source":"3",
		"kind":"host"
	}
]
```

where in this example we have two different redshift values quoted from three different sources, where two of the sources agree with one another, and the third source actually refers to the redshift of the host galaxy rather than the supernova. Note that all the numerical quantities are stored as strings instead of as numbers, the OSC's policy is to store the data with exactly the same number of significant digits as the sources that provide them, and storing the importing the data as floating point numbers can often introduce small floating-point errors that we wish to avoid.

In general, the data stored in a given JSON file are presented in the observer frame, uncorrected for extinction or redshift, with times provided in MJD or as a calendar date (YYYY/MM/DD). In some instances, only corrected data will be available, or will be available as a supplement to the raw data, but in these cases the corrected data should be tagged with additional qualifiers (e.g. `kcorrected`, `deredshifted`, etc.) to indicate that it has been manipulated. As with all tags, the source material is often unclear in how they provided the data; we attempt to figure this out from the original publication when possible, but this cannot always be determined.

Data quantities their own set of standard fields:

| Field | Value | Optional?
| :--- | :--- | :---
| `value` | The value of the quantity | no
| `e_value` | The error associated with the value | yes
| `e_lower_value` | The lower error bound associated with the value | yes
| `e_upper_value` | The upper error bound associated with the value | yes
| `lowerlimit` | Value is a lower limit | yes
| `upperlimit` | Value is an upper limit | yes
| `u_value` | The unit of the value | yes
| `kind` | Variant of the quantity | yes
| `derived` | Quantity is derived from other data present in file | yes
| `description` | A description of the quantity | yes
| `probability` | Probability of the given value being true | yes
| `source` | A list of integer aliases to sources for the data | no
| `model` | A list of integer aliases of which models the data orignated from | yes
| `realization` | A numeric ID for the realization of the denoted model (e.g. from Monte Carlo) | yes

Currently, the OSC explicitly tracks the following quantities for each supernova, if available (items marked with a ðŸŒŸ are supernova-specific):

So long as it is reasonable, the OSC is open to adding more field names should additional information need to be stored in an event file beyond the quantities and data we have chosen to track here, please contact us and let us know if you have any suggestions on how the standard format can be improved.
